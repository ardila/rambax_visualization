detailed description
============================

Basic visualization of different subdivisions of rhythm. Imagine a radial line spinning around in a circle, once every 2 beats.
Every time a drum hits, a new line lying on top of that one appears. This ray's color determined by which drum hit (ta = green, pax=yellow or gin=red).
This is what the first circle is.

You can imagine doing the same thing with a faster line that goes around once each beat, or twice each beat. 
This is what the second two circles are.
